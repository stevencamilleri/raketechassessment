## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

The WordPress site was developed through a local database via XAMPP. 

You would need to connect with the database from your own end to view the material by updating the wp-config.php credentials. 

I uploaded an .xml export of the database (database.xml found in the root folder) which you would need to import into your own database.

Looking forward to receive your feedback!
